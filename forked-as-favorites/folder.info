Forked repos that are forked for the purpose of tracking the repo as a favorite should go here. Maybe we could make shortcuts to repos instead that git can recognise. Naming convention can be something like repo.link. 

Repo links could allow projects to pull the source of any repo on demand and can be placed in any level of the repo. A module can be nothing more than a link to another repo.
